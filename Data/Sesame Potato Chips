INGREDIENTS
1 lb yukon gold potatoes, unpeeled, cut into wedges
1 Tbsp medium-high heat oil, avocado, grape seed, sunflower, etc.
2 Tbsp sesame seeds
1 Tbsp potato starch, optional, but makes fries extra crispy
1 Tbsp nutritional yeast, optional
generous pinch of salt, to taste
black pepper to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Lightly oil metal baking sheet, or cover with parchment paper. Toss potatoes in all ingredients until coated, if seeds don't stick, drizzle with a bit more oil.
Spread potatoes on baking sheet in an even layer (the more room between the wedges the better) and bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping once halfway through, until potatoes are golden brown and crispy. Serve immediately with condiments of choice. Enjoy!
