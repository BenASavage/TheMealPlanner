2 1/2 c. all-purpose flour*
1 tsp. kosher salt

stir together melted butter, both sugars, milk, and vanilla until combined.
Stir in flour and salt, then fold in chocolate chips.
Press cookie dough into prepared baking sheet, evening it out as much as possible (a cutting board can help).
Top with a second piece of parchment and freeze until firm, 1 hour.
Remove cookie dough from pan and place on a cutting board. Slice dough down the center.
