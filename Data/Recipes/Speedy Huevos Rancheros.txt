INGREDIENTS
2 cups store-bought hot red salsa*
Vegetable oil for frying
8 smallish corn tortillas (5 to 6 in.)
8 eggs
1 cup coarsely shredded jack cheese, plus extra for sprinkling on beans
1/4 cup chopped green onions
3 tablespoons grated cotija or parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons dried Mexican oregano or 2 tbsp. chopped fresh cilantro
2 cans (15 oz. each) refried beans, thinned with water if you like and warmed up in the microwave
INSTRUCTIONS
Put 4 heavy dinner plates in oven and preheat to 200Â°. Heat salsa in a small saucepan over low heat, covered.
Fill a large frying pan with 1/2 in. oil and heat over medium heat until the handle of a wooden spoon bubbles
when you stand it in the oil. Remove plates from oven. Using tongs, fry each tortilla 2 seconds per side.
Drain against side of pan, then overlap 2 tortillas on each warm plate. Pop in oven to keep warm.
Reduce heat to medium low. Cook 4 eggs, gently spooning oil over yolks to set them,
2 minutes for firm whites and runny yolks.
Spoon about 3 tbsp. warm salsa onto each plate of tortillas. Using a slotted spatula or spoon,
transfer 2 eggs to each plate, draining against side of pan first, and top with another 3 tbsp. salsa.
Keep warm in oven while frying and plating remaining 4 eggs.
(You may have to increase the heat a little for the second batch.)
Sprinkle eggs with jack cheese, then green onions, cotija, and oregano. Spoon beans alongside and top with jack cheese.
