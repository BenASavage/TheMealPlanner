INGREDIENTS
2 1/2 c. blueberries
Juice of 1/2 lemon
1 tbsp. granulated sugar
2 (8-oz.) blocks cream cheese, softened
1/2 c. granulated sugar
1/2 c. sour cream
1 tsp. pure vanilla extract
Pinch kosher salt
18 egg roll wrappers
Vegetable oil, for frying
Powdered sugar, for garnish
DIRECTIONS
Make blueberry sauce: In a small sauce pan over medium heat, combine blueberries, lemon juice, and sugar.
Bring to a simmer and cook until thick and jammy, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
Make cheesecake mixture: In a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat together cream cheese, sugar, sour cream,
vanilla, and kosher salt until fully combined.
Place an egg roll wrapper on a clean surface in a diamond shape and spoon approximately 2 tablespoons cream
cheese mixture into a line in the center. Top with a heaping spoonful of blueberry sauce. Fold up bottom half
and tightly fold in sides. Gently roll, then seal fold with a couple drops of water.
In a large skillet over medium heat, pour enough oil to reach 1" up the side of skillet.
Heat until oil starts to bubble when a drop of water is added.
Add egg rolls and fry until golden,1 minute per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to cool slightly.
Dust with powdered sugar and serve.
