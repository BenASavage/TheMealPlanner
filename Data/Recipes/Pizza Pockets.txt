INGREDIENTS
1 tablespoon olive oil
8 ounces Italian turkey sausage
1 cup tightly-packed arugula (about 1 ounce)
4 ounces cream cheese, room temperature
1/3 cup grated Parmesan, plus 1/4 cup
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 (13.5-ounce) package of store-bought pizza crust (recommended: Pillsbury)
All-purpose flour, for rolling out pizza dough
1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)
1 1/2 cups marinara sauce, store-bought or homemade
INSTRUCTIONS
Bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the broccoli and cook 1 minute.
Drain and rinse under cold water until cool; pat dry. Mix the broccoli, cheddar, sour cream and chives
in a bowl until combined, then squeeze the mixture together with your hands to make it compact.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and brush a baking sheet lightly with vegetable oil. On a floured surface,
roll out the dough and fill the dinner pockets. (See Cook's Note for step-by-step directions.)
Place the pockets seam-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Beat the egg and 1 tablespoon water in a small
bowl; brush the pockets with the egg wash. Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
